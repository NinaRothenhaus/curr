    Students choose their dataset, and begin to explore. In the process, they learn how to write their own definitions, first defining static values and then complete functions. They are also introduced to the Design Recipe: a structured approach to solving word problems and defining functions.

                            This file contains some new code that you haven't seen before. As with our Shapes file, we have a few @code{include} lines which import useful libraries for our course. This time, we also include a library that lets us work with Google Sheets:
                            @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                              include gdrive-sheets

                      @student{
                            On line 9, the @code{load-spreadsheet} function is used to load our animal shelter spreadsheet from Google Drive, and give that file a name: @code{shelter-sheet}. After that, we see the following code:
                            @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                              # load the 'pets' sheet as a table called animals

                            Just as you saw with our @code{shapes} example, this code @italic{defines a new table}. This time, it's called @code{animals-table}, and it's loaded from our Google Sheet. On line 12, you can see the names we are giving to each of the columns, called @code{name}, @code{species}, @code{gender}, @code{age}, @code{fixed}, @code{legs}, @code{pounts} and @code{weeks}.

                            Have students look back at the column names in the Google Sheet, and in the @code{load-table} function. Point out that they refer to the same columns, even though they have different names!

                        As you've seen, Pyret allows us to define names for values using the @code{=} sign. In math, you're probably used to seeing definitions like @math{x = 4}, which defines the name @code{x} to be the value @code{4}. Pyret works the same way, and you've already seen two names defined in this file: @code{shelter-sheet} and @code{animals-table}. We generally write definitions on the left, in the Definitions Area.
                        You can add your own definitions, for example:
                        @code[#:multi-line #t]{

                            @bannerline{Step 1: Contract and Purpose} The first thing we do is write a Contract for this function. You already know a lot about contracts: they tell us the Name, Domain and Range of the function. Our function tells us the year an animal was born, consumes an animal (represented by a @code{Row} in our table), and produces a @code{Number} representing the year. A Purpose Statement is just a description of what the function does:
                            @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                              birth-year :: (animal :: Row) -> Number
                              # Consumes an animal, and produces the year it was born

                      @student{
                            @bannerline{Step 2: Write Examples} You already know how to write examples for built-in functions, where we write the @italic{answer} we expect to get back. Just as we did before, we start with the name of the function we're writing, followed by an example input. Let's use some two pets we defined earlier for our first example.
                            @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                              birth-year :: (animal :: Row) -> Number
                              # Consumes an animal and produces the year it was born
                              examples:
                                birth-year(mittens) is 2016
                                birth-year(fritz)   is 2014 
                              end
                            }
                            While both examples here are correct, we want to use the second one that shows our work.

We start with the @code{fun} keyword (short for "function"), followed by the name of our function and a set of parentheses. This is exactly how all of our examples started, too. But instead of writing @code{pet1}, we'll use the @italic{label} that we gave it. Then we add a colon (@code{:}) in place of @code{is}, and continue to follow our examples, replacing anything we circled with the label. Finally, we finish with the @code{end} keyword.

							             Building functions is a powerful technique, which you'll use throughout the course. Today, you learned how to write functions that work on one row of a table at a time. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to use those functions to loop over an @italic{entire table}, letting us extend, filter, and sort our @code{animals-table}

							               If your students are working in pairs/groups, make sure that each student has access to a version of the program.  The student who saved the program to their Google Drive can share their program with anyone by hitting the Publish button in the top left, choosing "Publish a new copy", then clicking the "Share Link" option.  This will allow them to copy a link to the program, then send to their partners in an email/message.
